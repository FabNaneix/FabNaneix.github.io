## About the Lab

The Naneix Lab opened at the Rowett Institute, University of Aberdeen in June 2020 and is part of the “Healthy Lifecourse and Nutrition Neuroscience” research theme.
Our research is focused on the developmental aspects of the cognitive and neurobiological substrates underlying motivated behaviours, and how these processes are impacted by different early-life (childhood, adolescence) experiences, including unbalanced diets.

## Research Vision

Our lab focuses on developing and applying cutting-edge machine learning techniques to solve complex biological problems. We work at the intersection of computer science, biology, and medicine to:

- **Predict protein structures and functions** using deep learning models
- **Discover new drug targets** through computational screening
- **Analyze genomic data** to understand disease mechanisms
- **Develop open-source tools** for the scientific community

## Leadership & Mentorship

Prof. Smith has mentored over 30 PhD students and postdoctoral researchers, many of whom have gone on to successful careers in academia and industry. She is committed to fostering an inclusive and collaborative research environment where all team members can thrive.

## Awards & Recognition

- 2023 - National Science Foundation CAREER Award
- 2022 - Chan Zuckerberg Initiative Investigator
- 2021 - MIT Technology Review Innovator Under 40
- 2020 - NIH New Innovator Award

## Join Our Team

We are always looking for passionate researchers to join our lab. If you're interested in working at the forefront of computational biology and machine learning, please [contact us](/contact) with your CV and research interests.
